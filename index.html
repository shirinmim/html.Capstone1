    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Up to this moment, I had no experience in programming. At some point in my
      life, I decided to change my career by learning a new skill that would
      allow me to work more freely, without being tied to a specific location.
      While programming was not entirely unfamiliar to me since I knew that
      almost everything on the internet is connected to it. I became more aware
      of how deeply our daily lives are intertwined with technology. Realizing
      that there is never a "perfect time" for change, I decided to take the
      leap. I started my journey by enrolling in an online course by Angela Yu
      on Udemy Academy.
