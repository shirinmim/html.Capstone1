    <p>
      I enjoy simple things that keep me engaged and balanced. Here are a few of
      my favorites:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Planting in pots – Watching plants grow is satisfying.</li>
      <li>
        Podcasts & audiobooks – Mostly true crime and psychological thrillers.
      </li>
      <li>Movies – Same genres as my books, but I'm open to others too.</li>
      <li>
        Daily mindfulness – A few minutes of meditation and exercise every day
      </li>
      <li>Baking – I like to bake sometimes when I’m in the mood.</li>
      <li>My cats – They make life more fun.</li>
      <p>Hare some pictures of them:</p>
